           <!-- Update 06/08/2018 - Well it finally happened, Melbourne housing has cooled off. So here's your challenge; -->

# 1) when did it exactly happen?

# 2) Could you see it slowing down? What were the variables that showed the slowing down (was it overall price, amount sold vs unsold, change in more rentals sold and less housing, changes in which CouncilArea or Region, more houses sold in distances further away from Melbourne CBD and less closer)?

# 3) Could you have predicted it (I'm not sure how you would do this, but I'm sure you magicians have a way that would make me think we should burn you for being a witch)

# 4) Should I hold off even longer in buying a two bedroom apartment in Northcote?

           <!-- This is the real reason for me in publishing this dataset  -->
